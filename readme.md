# Tic Tac Toe
Small two-player game played in the console to test my newfound self-taught C++ knowledge.

### Gameplay
Generic Tic-Tac-Toe / Noughts & Crosses rules. You can win either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 

### Useful Keys
- When prompeted, enter a value from 1-9 to place your 'X' or 'O' in your wanted space.

Once again, this game is just simply played in the console. Putting together a few bits and pieces I have learnt over the past week or so.
